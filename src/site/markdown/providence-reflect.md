Providence Tools : Reflect
==========================

The `providence-reflect` library's purpose is to be able to reflect thrift
descriptors without having to invoke generated code. It has purposes like
conversion for debugging tools, and parsing and generating struct descriptors
in order to generate providence code (see `providence-tools-generator`).
